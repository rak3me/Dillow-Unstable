This is a folder that is excluded from the Github.

Any tools you import should be in this folder. The reason
for this is so that the GitHub doesn't get cluttered with
files that most developers don't need. Gaia, for instance,
is far too big to have in the Repo, and is best installed
manually by those who need it.
